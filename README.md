All the options that can be used are present in the [http-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server) documentation.

# Why

I wanted to have an easy way to spawn http-server to use it temporary to share files by demand. I've also wanted to have automatic builds
of new versions of http-server in a docker image because all images I see of http-server does not convince me.
